                <article class="main-grid__mid__question">
                    <h3>What can you do when you’re feeling stuck in your career?</h3>
                <p>Corinne went to Albright College and graduated in 2019 with a B.S. in business administration focusing on marketing and international Business. She had initiative and knew that to get a job, she needed more experience than his classes alone would provide. So she applied and secured internships.
    
                    Corinne’s first internship was at a B2B publication, where she would offer safety publication subscriptions to high-risk job fields. Her second internship was as an events and promotions intern at the Reading Fightin’ Phils to promote upcoming baseball games. These internships were primarily sales-related.
                    
                    Corinne felt limited by her internships. Since high school, she’s always enjoyed writing and creative work but didn’t think she could make a career of it. That was until she realized that digital marketing had the perfect combination between creativity and business practicality. Starting a career in digital marketing was her dream.
                    
                    How could she return to her creative roots and build a career she was truly passionate about in digital marketing?</p>
                </article>
                <article class="main-grid__mid__question">
                    <h3>Signing up to InspireMe to gain real skills</h3>
                <p>When you have no prior work experience, the first step to breaking into a new field is to learn the necessary skills for the job. Following that, you’ll need a professional network and experience to land your first interview.
    
                    Corinne’s innate determination to build a career she’d love wouldn’t allow her to settle for the limited experiences her internships offered. She wanted to build a career in digital marketing, and she was going to find a way to break into the industry.
                    
                    So she went searching online for opportunities to learn digital marketing.
                    
                    Her search led her to find InspireMe. She decided to sign up because she’d be able to meet real business owners, learn digital marketing skills from them, and be mentored by them. InspireMe provided the three things she’d need to enter the digital marketing industry:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The skills of a digital marketer; 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The professional network to connect you with opportunities and,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The experience sets your resume apart from the competition.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    When Corinne was on InspireMe, she browsed startups, entrepreneurs, and agencies interested in mentoring digital marketing talent through digital apprenticeships. For three months, she’d be able to learn from them without disrupting her busy school schedule because it was only 10 hours a week. So she created a profile and crafted a bio that showed her eagerness and determination to grow into a digital marketer.</p>

                <article class="main-grid__mid__question">
                    <h3>Building your portfolio and resume for a digital marketing job</h3>
                <p>If you want a resume that stands out, it’s better to have live projects rather than made-up case studies. It shows that you’ve had real clients or projects completed for a business. They’re also a great way to strengthen your resume with data about how much you’ve contributed to a business’s growth in sales, leads, traffic, etc. These are all things you need to get unstuck in your career.
    
                    Upon completing her three-month apprenticeship, Corinne would receive a certificate, have content to make case studies in her portfolio, and lots of experience to strengthen her resume. When on InspireMe, she connected with and started an apprenticeship with Colin Keeley, an early-stage VC, and podcaster who’s active within the tech sector in Chicago.</p>

                    <h3 class="quote">“Working with my mentor provided me with the guidance and instruction I needed to implement my classroom knowledge in real life. Having that experience gave me confidence in my digital marketing skillset and transformed how I stepped into my career."</h3>
                <p>Together, they worked on a startup Colin was growing at the time. They developed a social media strategy and began executing it. Corinne also crafted long-form blog posts to start building its SEO and organic traffic.
    
                    When reflecting on how her experience, Corinne shares,</p>

                    <h3 class="quote">“It was exactly what I was looking for.”</h3>
                <p>Corinne’s experience on InspireMe gave her the skills and opportunities she’d need to kick-start her digital marketing career. She’d come a long way since feeling stuck in her career during her previous internships.</p>
